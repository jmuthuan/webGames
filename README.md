# About this Site Web

This site was created as a hobby and personal use. It is intended for all people who are passionate about video games.

On the site you can search for your favorite games and have information about them.

The site allows you to search by entering keywords, by platforms (Xbox, PC, Nintendo and Playstation), and also by genres (you can select from more than 20 genres!). You can also sort the search results according to your preferences (Relevance, Name, Released Date, Popularity, Average Rating).

## Technologies
This site was built using React JS. Además se utilizó JSX, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap y Axios.
All data is pulled from the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) using Axios.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
